#The algorithm for this assignment is like this:
#user tells us the length of the sequence, which means that we will print out x amount of numbers in a sequence.
#the code is supposed to print out all three numbers below.
# for example: 1,2,3,(3+2+1) = 6, (6+3+2) = 11....
# you will need few integers. a_int, b_int and c_int, sum and a counter, which counts the input
# while the input is more or the same as the counter, it should summarize a_int, b_int and c_int.
#print out the sum and add 1 to the counter
